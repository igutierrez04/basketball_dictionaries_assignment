Assignment
    Paul is a fantasy football league manager, but also a programmer! He is trying to organize fantasy teams of players (that can be from any of the real teams) for his league website. There is already a web service that collects the line-up data from friends in batches.

    so far, he has been able to get a single list of dictionaries at a time from the API, and would like to put each team into a list of Player object instances, so that he can use methods related to players.


Challenge 1: Update the constructor
    - Update the constructor to accept a dictionary with a single player's information instead of individual arguments for the attribute.

Challenge 2: Create instances using individual player dictionaries.
    - Given these variables, create Player instances for each of the following dictionaries. Be sure to instantiate these outside the class definition, in the outer scope.

Challenge 3: Make a list of Player instances from a list of dictionaries
    - finally, given the example list of players at the top of this module (the one with many players) write a for loop that will populate an empty list with Player objects from the original list of dictionaries.
